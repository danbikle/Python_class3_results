# README.md

Instructions: 
  * Ensure that you are running Anaconda Python 4.2.0
  * run these shell commands:
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/danbikle/Python_class3_results demo1a
cd demo1a
~/anaconda3/bin/python fl10.py
```

At that point your shell should be locked by a webserver.

You need to then start another shell and type this command:

```bash
curl localhost:5000/static/blog.html
```

Holler if questions.
